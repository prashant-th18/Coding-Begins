Since you like Maths Problems a lot, your friend need a help in the following problem:

You are given a number. You want to compute the sum of all possible resulting numbers after applying the
`magic operation`.

In a magic operation, you select a non-empty subsequence from this number, then you remove these digits from
the number, then the remaining digits close the gap, and the resulting integer is the number after magic
operation.

For eg: Suppose number is *12345*, we select the subsequence *24*, then after removing these digits, the
number is *135*.

It is allowed for resulting number to contain leading zeros. If we removes all digits, the number is considered to be 0.

Since this sum can be very large, print it modulo (10^9 + 7);

Input:
The first and only line contains a single integer n ( 1 <= n <= 10^(100000))

Output:
In the only line, print the required sum modulo (10^9 + 7)

Examples:
Inp: 107
Out: 42

Note:
Non-Empty Subsegments we can remove from given number is : 1, 0, 7, 10, 07, 17, 107. After removing these
digits, the resulting numbers are 07, 17, 10, 7, 1, 0, 0 respectively. Their sum is 42.

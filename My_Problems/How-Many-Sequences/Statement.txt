Let's call a sequence of integers x1,x2,…,xk MEX-correct if for all i (1≤i≤k) |xi−MEX(x1,x2,…,xk)|≤1 holds. Where MEX(x1,…,xk) is the minimum non-negative integer that doesn't belong to the set x1,…,xk. For example, MEX(1,0,1,3)=2 and MEX(2,1,5)=0.

You are given an array a consisting of n non-negative integers. Calculate the number of non-empty MEX-correct subsequences of a given array. The number of subsequences can be very large, so print it modulo 998244353.

Note: a subsequence of an array a is a sequence [ai1,ai2,…,aim] meeting the constraints 1≤i1<i2<⋯<im≤n. If two different ways to choose the sequence of indices [i1,i2,…,im] yield the same subsequence, the resulting subsequence should be counted twice (i. e. two subsequences are different if their sequences of indices [i1,i2,…,im] are not the same).

Input:
The first line contains a single integer n (1≤n≤5⋅10^5).

The second line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤n).

Output:
For each test case, print a single integer — the number of non-empty MEX-correct subsequences of a given array, taken modulo 998244353.

Disjoint set is one of the advanced data structure present out there.
Motivation behind studying Disjoint Set:

1. Calculating no. of connected components
2. Finding the MST

As the name suggests, Disjoint Set has sets having distinct values.

Operations performed on Disjoint Set are:
1. Find(n):
            to find the set, 'n' belongs to.
            {1, 4, 7}    ,   {10, 14}
Parent ->       1               14      (Since we can't just give any character to specify this set as there can be                                         many sets, so therefore, from each set, we choose a single elem, and make                                          it as the parent)

find(4): will return 1
find(7): will return 1
find(10): will return 14

2. Union(a, b):
            to merge two sets (one in which 'a' belongs and other in which 'b' belongs).

A = {1, 4, 7},           B = {10, 14}

Union(1, 4) -> No effect as both elements present in the same set
Unoin(1, 10) -> Will merge sets A and B
